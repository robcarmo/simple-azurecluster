Directory Structure Explanation
.github/
workflows/: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD. (`build-and-push-docker.yml` and `deploy-to-aks.yml`)

app/: Contains the Node.js application code (`app.js`, `package.json`) and its `Dockerfile`.

helm/
sample-api/: Helm chart for deploying the sample Node.js API.
postgresql/: Helm chart for deploying PostgreSQL.

k8config/ : Contains extra configs for app and k8s.

Terraform Configuration (`terraform/`)
The root directory `terraform/` contains the main configuration (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`) responsible for orchestrating the deployment of various infrastructure modules.

Terraform Modules (`terraform/modules/`)
The `modules/` subdirectory houses individual modules for different Azure services:

acr/: Configures Azure Container Registry (ACR). (Actively used)
aks/: Configures Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). (Actively used)
database/: Configures Azure Database for PostgreSQL. (Actively used)
storage/: Configures Azure Storage. (Contains basic configuration, enabled by default)
app-insights/: Placeholder for Azure Application Insights. (Disabled by default via `module_enabled` variable)
networking/: Placeholder for networking resources (VNet, Subnets, NSGs). (Disabled by default via `module_enabled` variable)
log-analytics/: Placeholder for Azure Log Analytics workspace. (Disabled by default via `module_enabled` variable)

Each module is designed to be reusable and is called from the root `main.tf`. Modules can be enabled or disabled using the `module_enabled` variable within their respective `variables.tf` files (or overridden from the root). This allows for a flexible infrastructure setup where components can be included or excluded as needed.

CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

The CI/CD pipelines are managed using GitHub Actions. The workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

1.  **Terraform Infrastructure Workflow (`terraform-infra.yml`)**
    *   **Purpose:** Automates the provisioning and management of the Azure infrastructure using Terraform.
    *   **Trigger:** Runs on pushes to the `main` branch when changes are detected in the `terraform/` directory or the workflow file itself.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Checks out the code.
        *   Sets up Terraform.
        *   Logs into Azure using credentials stored in GitHub secrets.
        *   Runs `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
        *   Runs `terraform validate` to check the configuration's syntax.
        *   Runs `terraform plan` to create an execution plan.
        *   Runs `terraform apply -auto-approve` to apply the changes to the infrastructure. This step is conditional and only runs on pushes to the `main` branch.

2.  **Build and Push Docker Image (`build-and-push-docker.yml`) - Temporarily Disabled**
    *   **Original Purpose:** Builds the Docker image for the sample Node.js API and pushes it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
    *   **Current Status:** This workflow is temporarily disabled by having its job steps commented out. The trigger is on pushes to `main` for changes in `app/**` or `app/Dockerfile`.

3.  **Deploy to AKS (`deploy-to-aks.yml`) - Temporarily Disabled**
    *   **Original Purpose:** Deploys the sample Node.js API and PostgreSQL to the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Helm charts.
    *   **Current Status:** This workflow is temporarily disabled by having its job steps commented out. The trigger is on pushes to `main` for changes in `helm/**` or the workflow file itself.

**Note on Workflow Activation:**
The application build and deployment workflows (`build-and-push-docker.yml` and `deploy-to-aks.yml`) can be re-enabled by uncommenting their job steps once the infrastructure is successfully provisioned and ACR/AKS details are available and configured (potentially as secrets or outputs from the Terraform workflow).
Deployment Process
Build and Push Docker Image:

The CI workflow builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the `app/` directory.
The built image is tagged and pushed to Azure Container Registry.
Deploy to AKS:

The CD workflow retrieves the latest image from ACR.
Helm is used to deploy the application (and PostgreSQL) to the AKS cluster, applying configurations specified in the Helm charts located in `helm/sample-api/` and `helm/postgresql/`.

Summary

The CI/CD pipeline leverages GitHub Actions to automate the build, push, and deployment processes. Docker images are built and pushed to ACR, and the application is deployed to AKS using Helm charts. This setup ensures a streamlined and automated workflow for deploying updates to the sample Node.js API, with all necessary configurations and secrets managed securely within GitHub and Azure.


Deployment and CI/CD Explanation
Deployment Steps
Step 1: Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

Initialize Terraform to set up the working directory for configuration files.
Plan the infrastructure deployment, allowing review of the execution plan.
Apply the Terraform configuration to create the necessary infrastructure, including the AKS cluster, ACR, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and other components.
Step 2: Build and Push Docker Image to ACR

Build the Docker image for the sample Node.js API from the Dockerfile in the `app/` directory.
Login to Azure Container Registry to authenticate Docker with ACR.
Push the built Docker image to ACR for storage and later deployment.
Step 3: Deploy Application to AKS with Helm

Package the Helm chart to prepare it for deployment.
Install or upgrade the Helm charts to deploy the sample Node.js API and PostgreSQL to the AKS cluster.
Verify the deployment to ensure everything is running correctly.
CI/CD Pipeline Explanation
Build and Push Docker Image (`build-and-push-docker.yml`)

This workflow builds a Docker image for the sample Node.js API and pushes it to ACR. It is triggered by pushes to the main branch and performs the following steps:
Checkout the latest code from the repository.
Set up Docker Buildx for multi-platform image builds.
Authenticate with Azure and ACR.
Build and push the Docker image to ACR.
Deploy to AKS (`deploy-to-aks.yml`)

This workflow deploys the Docker image (and PostgreSQL) to AKS using Helm. It is triggered by pushes to the main branch and performs the following steps:
Checkout the latest code from the repository.
Authenticate with Azure.
Configure kubectl to interact with the AKS cluster.
Retrieve AKS cluster credentials to configure kubectl.
Deploy the sample Node.js API and PostgreSQL to the AKS cluster using Helm.
Testing Steps
1. Access the Application

Retrieve the service details to get the external IP address for the Node.js API.
Open a web browser and navigate to the external IP address to access the application.
2. Verify Pod Status

Check the status of the pods (for both the API and PostgreSQL) to ensure they are running correctly.
If any pods are not running correctly, check the logs for troubleshooting.
3. Run Automated Tests

Define and run tests locally to verify application functionality, including database interaction.
Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing after deployment.
Summary
This deployment process ensures that your sample Node.js API (with PostgreSQL) is built, pushed, and deployed in a streamlined manner using Terraform, Docker, and Helm. The CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment steps, leveraging GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Testing steps include verifying the application via the public IP, ensuring all pods are running correctly, and integrating automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline. This setup allows for efficient and scalable application deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service.

Note: All secrets required for GitHub and Kubernetes manifests are not included in this documentation due to time restrictions, but they should be considered a critical part of this work.
